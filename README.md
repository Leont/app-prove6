NAME
====

prove6 - Run tests through a TAP harness.

USAGE
=====

    prove6 [options] [files or directories]

Boolean options:

    -v,  --verbose      Print all test lines.
    -l,  --lib          Add 'lib' to the path for your tests (-Ilib).
         --shuffle      Run the tests in random order.
         --ignore-exit  Ignore exit status from test scripts.
         --reverse      Run the tests in reverse order.
    -q,  --quiet        Suppress some test output while running tests.
    -Q,  --QUIET        Only print summary results.
         --timer        Print elapsed time after each test.
         --trap         Trap Ctrl-C and print summary on interrupt.
         --help         Display this help
         --version      Display the version
         --loose        Ignores subtests

Options that take arguments:

    -I,  --incdir       Library paths to include.
    -e,  --exec         Interpreter to run the tests ('' for compiled
                        tests.)
         --ext          Set the extensions for tests (default <t rakutest t6>)
         --harness      Define test harness to use.  See TAP::Harness.
         --reporter     Result reporter to use. See REPORTERS.
    -j,  --jobs         Run N test jobs in parallel (try 9.)
         --err=stderr   Direct the test's $*ERR to the harness' $*ERR.
         --err=merge    Merge test scripts' $*ERR with their $*OUT.
         --err=ignore   Ignore test script' $*ERR.

NOTES
=====

Default Test Directory
----------------------

If no files or directories are supplied, `prove6` looks for all files matching the pattern `t/*.t`.

Colored Test Output
-------------------

Colored test output is the default, but if output is not to a terminal, color is disabled.

Color support requires `Terminal::ANSIColor` on Unix-like platforms. If the necessary module is not installed colored output will not be available.

Exit Code
---------

If the tests fail `prove6` will exit with non-zero status.

`-e`
----

Normally you can just pass a list of Perl 6 tests and the harness will know how to execute them. However, if your tests are not written in Perl 6 or if you want all tests invoked exactly the same way, use the `-e` switch:

    prove6 -e='/usr/bin/ruby -w' t/
    prove6 -e='/usr/bin/perl -Tw -mstrict -Ilib' t/
    prove6 -e='/path/to/my/customer/exec'

`--err`
-------

  * `--err=stderr`

    Direct the test's $*ERR to the harness' $*ERR.

    This is the default behavior.

  * `--err=merge`

    If you need to make sure your diagnostics are displayed in the correct order relative to test results you can use the `--err=merge` option to merge the test scripts' $*ERR into their $*OUT.

    This guarantees that $*OUT (where the test results appear) and $*ERR (where the diagnostics appear) will stay in sync. The harness will display any diagnostics your tests emit on $*ERR.

    Caveat: this is a bit of a kludge. In particular note that if anything that appears on $*ERR looks like a test result the test harness will get confused. Use this option only if you understand the consequences and can live with the risk.

    PS: Currently not supported.

  * `--err=ignore`

    Ignore the test script' $*ERR

`--trap`
--------

The `--trap` option will attempt to trap SIGINT (Ctrl-C) during a test run and display the test summary even if the run is interrupted

$*REPO
------

`prove6` introduces a separation between "options passed to the perl which runs prove" and "options passed to the perl which runs tests"; this distinction is by design. Thus the perl which is running a test starts with the default `$*REPO`. Additional library directories can be added via the `PERL6LIB` environment variable, via -Ifoo in `PERL6OPT` or via the `-Ilib` option to `prove6`.
